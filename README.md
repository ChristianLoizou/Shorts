# Shorts
Some smaller projects which don't each deserve their own repository.

## Installation and Usage
### Windows
The latest version of any project can be found in _.exe_ format at: __{PROJECT}__/latest.exe. 

### Mac / Linux
_Work in progress_

### Source
To compile from source code, you can clone into the git repository, and execute the latest version found at: __{PROJECT}__/main.py. The commands to do this are:

```
git clone git@github.com:ChristianLoizou/Shorts.git
cd shorts/{PROJECT}
python37 main.py
``` 
NOTE: [Python version 3.7+](https://python.org/downloads/) is required to compile from source. You also need [git command line](https://git-scm.com/) to clone from the command line. If you don't want to clone the whole repo, download:
 - *main.py* - Source code file
 - *assets/* - Contains icons / other assets
 - *application_update.py* - Can be left out if you don't need the auto-update feature

 If you plan on leaving out *application_update.py*, check first that the version you are using is capable of running without it. 12toneapp v1.6.1, intervalpractice v1.5 and parallelchecker v1.4.2 are the earliest versions that allow for execution without checking for updates.
